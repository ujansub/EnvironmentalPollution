Hepatitis A infection is a self-limiting disease that does not lead to chronic infection/liver disease."
Malaria,34,4000,medium,water_pollution,"Malaria is a disease caused by parasites, which are spread by female mosquitos calledAnopheles. Mosquitos breed in water, and when they bite a person infected with malaria, they can spread the infection to other people."
Polyomavirus Infection,35,7000,medium,water_pollution,"The name polyoma refers to the viruses' ability to produce multiple (poly-) tumors (-oma). Polyomavirus are tumor viruses that affect animals and humans.

Fluorosis,38,1500,medium,water_pollution,This is a condition that leads to serious bone disease and is caused by high levels of fluoride naturally found in groundwater. It occurs in more than 25 countries around the world and estimates suggest that tens of millions of people may be affected
Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm Disease),39,3000,medium,water_pollution,"This is one of the diseases caused by water pollution in Africa. People are infected with the worms when they drink water contaminated with the larvae. These larvae develop into mature adult Guinea worms, which can grow up to a meter long. They leave the body after living there for about one year, leaving debilitating ulcers."
Intestinal Worms,40,54000,medium,water_pollution,"Parasitic intestinal worms (helminthes/roundworms, whipworms and/or hookworms) can be transmitted through contaminated food and soil contaminated with human feces. It is estimated that up to 10 percent of the population, mostly children, has intestinal worms that can cause anemia, malnutrition, or growth retardation. Children are particularly susceptible and typically have the largest number of worms. It can be prevented by good sanitation and hygiene and use of clean drinking water and food."
Trachoma (Eye Infection),41,30000,medium,water_pollution,This infection spreads through poor hygiene and sanitation caused by the lack of adequate safe water supply. It is more likely to affect women and children. Approximately 6 million people with trachoma have developed blindness. Studies show that providing people with adequate water supply can significantly reduce infection rates.
Typhoid Fever,42,10000,medium,water_pollution,"This common bacterial infection affects around 12 million people annually. It is caused by the ingestion of contaminated food and water. Symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, andheadache."
